# Learning about Git and GitHub #

Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is used to coordinate work among computer coders and can be used to track changes in any set of files. Think of it as the "saved as" command whenever you are working within a Word document. You essentially save a new version of the file each time after changes are made.

```
$git config --list
