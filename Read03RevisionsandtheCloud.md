# Learning about Git and GitHub #

**Git** is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is used to coordinate work among computer coders and can be used to track changes in any set of files. Think of it as the **"saved as"** command whenever you are working within a Word document. You essentially save a new version of your document--or file--each time after changes are made. But when using **Git**, instead of referring to this process as *"save"*, we refer to it as *"commit"*. 

To check your **Git** settings, use the `git config --list` command.  When I check my **Git** settings, this is what it looked like:
```
$git config --list
user.name=Sue Gehling
user.email=sue@classroomclinic.com
```
**GitHub** is a repository that lives in the cloud, and allows people to host their open source projects. It is essentially the largest host of source code in the world. With GitHub, you can make changes to your project while working on your local computer, and then push those changes out into the cloud repository (and vice versa). To be able to push changes made in your code from your desktop to your cloud-based repository, you need to "link" the two together. This can be accomplished through a process known as ***cloning***. 

Click [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) to learn the steps you must follow to create a copy of an existing GitHub repository by using the ***clone*** command. The cloned repository will now also be present on your local computer's hard drive, allowing you to record changes to both locations in real time.


Now that your repository has been ***cloned***, just follow these easy steps whenever making changes:
1. Add
2. Commit
3. Push
