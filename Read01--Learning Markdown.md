# Markdown Explanation (from one novice, to another)

Prior to taking these Delta V coding classes, I had never heard of ***markdown*** before. 

To be honest, the first thing I pictured in my mind when I heard the phrase was, "write this down".

I was clearly wrong.  After my head stopped spinning, I wondered why the phrase was not referred to as ***markup***.

I mean, if you have done any editing within a Word document before, you would know that you can track any changes made to a document. Those changes are referred to as ***markup***.

Oh, could it be this simple?  

### Markdown = Markup.

Probably not.

So to explain it another way, ***markdown*** is essentially the act of performing any formating or layout design you want for your code. I consider it to be the [Process of Editing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editing). 

For example, you could *italicize* some of the text, or you could **bold face*** some of the text.  If you really wanted to emphasize a particular word, you could both *italicize* and **bold face** the word, and it would look ***like this***.

You can even emphasize lists within your text, which is helpful when you are discussing your favorite flavors of ice cream:
  1. Vanilla
  2. Chocolate
  3. Chocolate Chip
