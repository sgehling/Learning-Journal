### About Me
  Hello. My name is Sue Gehling. I live on an acreage near Carroll with my husband and four children. We just celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary. My husband has a business called [GehlPRO Welding](http://gehlprowelding.com/). I have a business as well. It is called **Classroom Clinic**. It is a school-based telehealth company. 
  
  My oldest child will be a senior at Iowa State University in the fall.  He is majoring in [Agriculture Systems Technology](https://www.abe.iastate.edu/undergraduate-students/agricultural-systems-technology/). My oldest daughter will be a sophomore at the [University of Iowa](https://www.nursing.uiowa.edu/); she is majoring in their nursing program. I have another daughter who will be in 10th grade and a third daughter who will be in 4th grade this fall. They both attend [Kuemper Catholic school]( https://www.kuemper.org/) in Carroll. 
  
  I am a [Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric-mental_health_nurse_practitioner), with a passion for providing children's mental healthcare.  There is a huge need for child psychiatry providers, especially in rural communities. I recently decided to start a school-based telehealth company, called [Classroom Clinic](https://www.classroomclinic.com/).  My vision is to improve children's access to mental health care by utilizing technology and integrating services into nontraditional places. 
  
  The reason I am taking this class is so I can have a better understanding of computer coding, and how it might provide a competitive advantage for my telehealth business.
