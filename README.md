### About me
  I live on an acreage near Carroll with my husband and four children. We just celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary. My husband has a business called GehlPRO Welding. I have a business as well. It is called Classroom Clinic.
  My oldest child will be a senior at Iowa State University in the fall, and my oldest daughter will be a sophomore at the University of Iowa.  I also have a daughter who will be in 10th grade and a third daughter that will be in 4th grade. They both attend Kuemper Catholic school in Carroll. 
  I am a Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner, with a passion for providing children's mental heralthcare.  There is a huge need for child psychiatry providers, especially in rural communities. I recently decided to start a school-based telehealth company, which I called Classroom Clinic.  My vision is to improve children's access to mental health care by utilizing technology and integrating services into nontraditional places. 
  The reason I am taking this class is so I can have a better understanding of computer coding, and how it might provide a competitive advantage for my telehealth business.
