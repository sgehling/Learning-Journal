# Different types of text editors, *and features you should consider*.
Important features to consider when evaluating text editors include the following:
- **Code Completion**: Code completion allows you to start typing, and the code completion feature displays possible suggestions based on what you originally typed. This feature makes writing code much more efficient, with less potential for errors.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: This feature takes the text you type and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text. This allows for easier identification of the code you are writing. 
- **Variety of Themes**: Themes allow you to change the color of your background of your text editor, as well as provide a series of colors in your text. This feature, which allows you to use a dark background and brightly colored text, is easier on your eyes, thus reducing eye strain and fatigue.
- **Extensions**: Extensions are similar to plug-ins that give you more functionality that you wouldn't otherwise have. Extensions are like plugins for your text editor, that allows you to have superpowers that you wouldn't otherwise have.
