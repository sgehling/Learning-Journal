# Different types of text editors, *and features you should consider*.
Important features to consider when evaluating text editors include the following:
- #Code Completion#:Code completion allows you to start typing, and the code completion feature displays possible suggestions based on what you originally typed.
- Syntax Highlighting
This feature takes the text you type and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text.
- Variety of Themes
Themes allow you to change the color of your background of your text editor, as well as provide a series of colors in your text.
- Selection of extensions
Extensions are similar to plug-ins that give you more functionality that you wouldn't otherwise have.


For now, take notes on how commands are used, and which look similar to how you are used to using the GUI File Explorer/Finder.
