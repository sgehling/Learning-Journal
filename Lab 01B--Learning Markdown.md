 To me, ***growth mindset*** represents an attribute that people who are continuous learners possess. They understand that in the world we live today, "change is inevitable, but survival is optional". I believe anxiety and underlying fear is what inhibits many people who have *fixed mindsets*.

Three different things that help to keep me in a ***growth mindset*** include:
  1. Developing a strategy for the growth, with a rationale for why I want to experience the growth
  2. Frequently review the progress that I'm making towards the goals I set
  3. Celebrating the things I accomplish, no matter how small or irrelevant they may seen to be.
